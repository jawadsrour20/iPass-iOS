# iPass-iOS
iPass is a password manager app that safely stores all the user's accounts in one place.

Steps to run the application:



1. Have cocoapods installed using the command (from the project directory)

```Bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
sudo gem install ffi
pod install
```



2. Now we access and build/run the project from the .xcworkspace file extension. This is because we now have 3rd party libraries installed and the link to them is automatically done in the .xcworkspace.
